# Project Euler

This is one of many attempt to find the solution to the problem presented on projecteuler.net.

The files present in this repo are named as such:

`### - {problem_name}.{ext}`

Where:

- `###` is the problem number padded to 3 digits with `0`s,
- `{problem_name}` is the name of the problem with the number previously mentioned, and
- `{ext}` is the file extension, which is expected to be dominated by `py`.

This project will be mainly using **Python 3**. Every file will have the solution variable `sol`, typically with the type of `int`. The last non-empty line of every program should print out the content of this variable.
